The Goal:
Reach a height of 3 levels before your opponent.

Rules:
The game is played on a square grid of a given size. Both players start with one unit placed randomly on the grid.

Both players take it in turns to perform an action with their unit. To win the game, players must get their unit to climb up cells and reach a height of 3 levels.

The grid
Cells can be floors or holes. A floor is represented by an integer, a hole is represented by a dot (.). Holes are considered as outside the playable area.
Each cell in the playable area has a height going from 0 to 3. A height of 4 is outside the playable area.

The units
Each unit occupies a cell in the playable area of the grid and has the power to MOVE and then BUILD.
A unit may moveIn to any neighboring cell, including diagonals. The unit may only moveIn on the same level, step up one level or step down any number of levels.
After every movement, the unit must be able to buildIn onto an adjacent cell of its new position. This causes the cell in question to gain 1 unit of height.
If the height reaches level 4, the cell is considered removed from play.
If your unit moves onto a level 3 cell, you win the game.

Actions

Every turn, your unit must perform a valid pair of actions:
MOVE&BUILD: The unit moves in a given direction on the grid, then places an extra level on a neighboring cell.
